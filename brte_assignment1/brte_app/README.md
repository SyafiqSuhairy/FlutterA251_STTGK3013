## 3.0 Book Reading Time Estimator Application & Description
BRTE (Book Reading Time Estimator) is a simple, single-purpose Flutter utility app. It allows a user to estimate how many days it will take them to finish reading a book. The user provides the book's total page count, their average reading speed, and the number of hours they plan to read each day to get the final-day estimate.

## 4.0 Inputs, Process & Output
* **Inputs :**
    * **Total Pages:** A numeric value entered into a `TextField` (e.g., `350`).
    * **Hours per Day:** A numeric value entered into a `TextField` (e.g., `2.5`).
    * **Reading Speed:** A category selected from a `DropdownButton` ('Slow', 'Average', 'Fast'), which corresponds to a pre-set value of pages per hour (20, 30, or 40).

* **Process :**
    1.  The user presses the "Calculate" `ElevatedButton`.
    2.  The app validates the inputs. If either `TextField` is empty or contains non-numeric characters (like letters), the calculation stops, and a `SnackBar` error is shown.
    3.  If valid, the app gets the `pagesPerHour` value from the selected reading speed.
    4.  It first calculates the total hours needed: `Total Hours = Total Pages / Pages per Hour`.
    5.  It then calculates the total days: `Total Days = Total Hours / Hours per Day`.
    6.  The app calls `setState()` to update the `resultInDays` state variable with the final value, rounded to two decimal places.

* **Outputs :**
    * The app displays the final calculated time in a separate `Container` at the bottom of the screen (e.g., `Estimated Time: 5.0 Days`). If the inputs are invalid, this result is reset to `0.0`.

## 5.0 Widget List Used
* `Scaffold`, `AppBar`
* `Text`
* `TextField` (with `TextEditingController`)
* `DropdownButton`
* `ElevatedButton`
* `Row` / `Column`
* `Container`
* `SingleChildScrollView`
* `Image` (for Splash Screen)
* `CircularProgressIndicator` (for Splash Screen)
* `SnackBar` (for validation)

## 6.0 Basic Validation Used
The app uses `SnackBar` messages for validation, matching the method shown in class. When the "Calculate" button is pressed, two checks are performed:

1.  **Empty Field Check:** It checks if the `pagesController.text` or `hoursController.text` is empty. If either is empty, a `SnackBar` with the message "Please fill in all fields" is shown.
2.  **Numeric Check:** It uses `double.tryParse()` to check if the inputs are valid numbers. If `tryParse` returns `null` (meaning the user entered letters or invalid symbols), a `SnackBar` with the message "Please enter valid numbers..." is shown.

The calculation only proceeds if both of these checks pass.
